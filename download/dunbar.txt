[01:18:44] Rabid Disconnection > when we joined escalated
[01:18:48] Nirola Freemist > Yeah, Nyst and I were trying man.  We really were to get us content
[01:19:26] Rabid Disconnection > yeah I get that, I dont hold any blame at all and I get it
[01:19:40] Rabid Disconnection > it just makes me sad. I did explain this out in detail 4 months ago
[01:20:40] Nirola Freemist > Yeah, unfortunately 4 months ago we didn't have too many options besides sit in CLONE and have little content.  Least this way we got on somebody's radar who wants us.
[01:21:08] Rabid Disconnection > to be honest, I think we had more bargaining power before
[01:22:24] Nirola Freemist > We had more autonomy before, but not sure about more bargaining power.
[01:23:05] Rabid Disconnection > i dunno.
[01:23:21] Rabid Disconnection > we couldve joined swear and been snuff bait legit
[01:23:55] Nirola Freemist > lol, but then we would have been dealing with a Euro time zone alliance again with very few americans
[01:24:05] Nirola Freemist > We would have been in the same boat as before.
[01:24:17] Rabid Disconnection > yeah but instead of 1 or 2 guys, snuff has 10-15 in their offtime
[01:24:36] Rabid Disconnection > which melds well with our smaller gangs
[01:37:04] Nirola Freemist > I dunno man, i'm just trying to get content
[01:38:17] Rabid Disconnection > i know, seriously man I completely understand
[01:40:15] Nirola Freemist > Believe me my first choice would have been for CLONE to succeede, but unfortunately it didn't we coudln't get the people.
